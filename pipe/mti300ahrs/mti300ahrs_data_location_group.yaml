    # Detect if we have data coming from Kafka or Trino

    # ... so that if there is any overlap in sensor data coming from both Kafka and Trino on the same day, the ...
    # ... trino data wins (filter joiner will not copy a file if it is already in the destination). This scenario ...
    # ... should only arise during initial data load and a site back-streams data from kafka outside the Kafka ...
    # ... retention period for data that have already been loaded from Trino. In normal operations this scenario ...
    # ... should not arise because the only data coming into Pachyderm will be coming from Kafka. ...
    # ... When a conflict does arise, the Trino data will take precedence, which is fine because the ...
    # ... conflict arose because data for the same sensor and day were in both locations.
