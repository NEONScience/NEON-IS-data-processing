# Install eddy4R.base from development branch (only until merged into open source version) 
# NOTE: Currently the eddy4R development repo is private and requires
# Sys.setenv(GITHUB_PAT = "MyAccessToken") to be assigned in R. Thus, we will pass this environment 
# variable in from the host, clone the repo in this intermediate build, then copy the relevant package 
# into the final build and install from there. To pass in the environment variable holding the token,
# use: docker build --build-arg auth_token=$GITHUB_PAT ...
#ARG auth_token
#ENV GITHUB_PAT=$auth_token
#
# Clone the NEON-FIU-algorithm repo using our token
#RUN git clone -b deve https://$GITHUB_PAT:x-oauth-basic@github.com/NEONScience/NEON-FIU-algorithm.git
#
# Now make the final build, which will leave behind our access token
#FROM us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/neon-shared-service/neonscience/neon-is-pack-base-r:v1.4.8
