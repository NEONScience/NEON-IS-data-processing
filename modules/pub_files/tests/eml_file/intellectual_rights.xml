	<para>In most countries, data and facts are not copyrightable. By putting NEON data into the public domain, we encourage broad use, particularly in scientific analyses and data aggregations. However, please be mindful of the following scholarly norms:
		* NEON data should be used in a way that is mindful of the limitations of the data, using the documentation associated with the data packages as a guide.
		* Unlike most scientific data, NEON data is not associated with individual authors; rather, the ‘author’ of data produced by the Observatory is NEON itself. Attributions and citations should be made to NEON for any use of the data.
