\title{Individual measurement uncertainty for dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration (mg/L) as part of the water
quality data product}
\usage{
def.ucrt.wq.do.conc(
  data = data.frame(data = base::numeric(0)),
  infoCal = NULL,
  varUcrt = base::names(data)[1],
  calSlct = NULL,
  Meta = list(),
  log = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric data frame of raw measurements.}

\item{infoCal}{List of calibration and uncertainty information read from a NEON calibration file
(as from NEONprocIS.cal::def.read.cal.xml). Included in this list must be infoCal$ucrt, which is
a data frame of uncertainty coefficents. Columns of this data frame are:\cr
\code{Name} String. The name of the coefficient. \cr
\code{Value} String or numeric. Coefficient value. Will be converted to numeric. \cr}

\item{varUcrt}{A character string of the target variable (column) in the data frame \code{data} 
that represents Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration data. Note that for other
uncertainty functions this variable may not need to be in the input data frame, so long as the function
knows that. Defaults to the first column in \code{data}.}

\item{calSlct}{Unused in this function. Defaults to NULL. See the inputs to 
NEONprocIS.cal::wrap.ucrt.dp0p for what this input is.}

\item{Meta}{Unused in this function. Defaults to an empty list. See the inputs to 
NEONprocIS.cal::wrap.ucrt.dp0p for what this input is.}

\item{log}{A logger object as produced by NEONprocIS.base::def.log.init to produce structured log
output in addition to standard R error messaging. Defaults to NULL, in which the logger will be
created and used within the function.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following variables:\cr
\code{ucrtMeas} - combined measurement uncertainty for an individual L0 reading.
}
\description{
Alternative calibration uncertainty function. Create file (dataframe) with
uncertainty information based off of the L0 dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration data values
according to NEON.DOC.004931 - NEON Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD): Water Quality.

Note: This script implements logging described in \code{\link[NEONprocIS.base]{def.log.init}},
which uses system environment variables if available.
